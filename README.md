<!--&nbsp is a workaround for indentation in markdown -->

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to delving into the world of coding, I held a rather uninspired view of software engineering ‚Äì something mundane, excessively mathematical, and frankly unexciting. It wasn't a career path I envisioned for myself. However, upon graduating high school, I found myself at a crossroads, with no clear direction ahead. It was during this time that I stumbled upon countless videos featuring charismatic individuals, often with charming British accents, promising lucrative salaries of $200K or more for those who mastered the art of coding. Intrigued and somewhat skeptical, I decided, "Why not give it a try?" 
<br>
    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the moment I typed my inaugural "print('Hello World')" command, I was captivated. Programming ignited a passion within me that I hadn't anticipated. As I ventured further into the labyrinth of software development, I discovered a profound joy in crafting practical, elegant, and aesthetically pleasing applications. There's something immensely satisfying about showcasing a project to someone unfamiliar with the world of coding and witnessing their genuine awe, rather than presenting a simplistic command-line interface. <br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, I've dedicated myself to honing my skills as a frontend developer and, indeed, as a developer overall. These days, my focus lies in building React and React Native applications that not only impress myself and my peers but also catch the eye of recruiters and potential employers. Each day presents an opportunity for growth, both as a software developer and as a human being, and I eagerly embrace the challenge of bettering myself in both realms.
